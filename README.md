# docker-registry-playground

Playground for running docker registry v2 wired to UDS keycloak.

Currently launching docker with `docker compose` -- it isn't running inside UDS at this time.

`uds run dev` should get it up and running and push an image, including executing scripts for small tweaks that had to happen to get it working with UDS at this time.
